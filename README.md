### Planned Features
- LP, MP, HP -> Low, Medium, Priority

**Application**
- Rather than signing in, users will create unique URLs for each of their palettes. Easy sharing etc. - HP

- Find good icons for save - LP

**Upload**
- Style upload feature - LP

**Palette**
- Name palettes on save -> display palette names rather than the unique Firebase string - MP

<!-- - Delete palettes that you don't care about - HP -->
<!-- - See full color previews of the palettes - HP -->
- Shuffle colors for inspiration? - LP
- Copy entire palette as JS object or Sass text - HP
- Add tag system for each palette? - LP
